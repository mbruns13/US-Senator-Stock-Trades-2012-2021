### Proposal

There has been increased concern over whether the stock trading of members in the U.S. congress are over performing the market. With this dataset of trading records for U.S. Senators from 2012 to 2021, we seek to answer if our representatives have an inherent, unfair advantage while trading.

Several indicators we will use from this dataset to determine stock trading performance are:
- Relative size of purchase or sale in individual stock
- Performance of individual stock vs the market as a whole
- Performance of individual stock over either one-month or one-yearâ€™s time

Other characteristics we will use to filter/compare data are:
- Owner of the trade (Senator, spouse, or child)
- Political party of trader
- Sex of trader
- Sector of individual stock

### Extract

The data for senator stock trades was found on the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/XPDSYQ) site and was downloaded as a .txt file. This dataset contained information about the senators and their stock trades between 2012 and 2021. It also includes trades reported by their spouses and/or children.

We also used [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) to add sectors associated with each ticker/company. We had first tried using several APIs, but ran into issues with the amount of calls allowed per minute and runtime. We decided to scrape the Yahoo Finance site for this sector data instead.

### Transform

Once we extracted the trades information from the Harvard Dataverse site, we were able to read that .txt file into pandas as a csv and work with it as a DataFrame. To clean this data, we dropped all rows with null values in the stock ticker column, changed the political party and sex columns from binary values to descriptive strings, changed the date column values to datetime values, and merged the min and max trades columns into one to show the range of the amount. We also renamed the columns to make the values easier to understand.

We used BeautifulSoup to scrape the Yahoo Finance pages for each unique ticker, and appended each company's sector as a string in a new list. We then created a dictionary, using the unique ticker code as keys and the sector string as values. With this dictionary, were able to create a new list of sectors in same order as the list of all tickers in the trades DataFrame, and add a new sector column with the corresponding values.

### Load

All of our data was loaded into a relational database, using pgAdmin and PostgreSQL. We chose to use a relational database for this data because ...
